                            <p>
                                The production prototypes and demos serve to
                                work as parallel experiences to the production
                                app where I can collaborate with other designers and build
                                upcoming interaction or motion rich features that then serve as
                                blueprints and usable UI code for the production
                                engineering implementation. This helps us
                                achieve a highly crafted experience in our final
                                product.

                                            This is a collection of production

                                            understand what is possible in our

                                            it gets to them, and ensure our

                                            and polish our users deserve. There

                                            Though technically never used for
                                            production, I spent my first year at
                                            Vrbo building this prototype of the
                                            entire Traveler experience. This
                                            prototype did consume our production
                                            APIs, but for the sake of stability,
                                            it now just uses a scraped, static
                                            version of this data. It is a
                                            responsive experience that works for
                                            both desktop and mobile web. Try it
                                            out for a trip to "Chamonix".

                                            filters options on our Search page.
                                            The most interesting part of this
                                            prototype is the iOS tumbler pattern
                                            I created for the price filters.
                                            Check it out on mobile, or at least
                                            in a your browser's mobile emulator,
                                            because the buttons relies on touch
                                            events in order to give a responsive
                                            feel.
