                            <p>
                                My initial focus at Vrbo was building high-fidelity prototypes for user labs. I quickly realized that there were other prototyping worksflows that would have high impact. Production prototypes and demos serve to
                                work as parallel experiences to the production
                                app where I can collaborate with other designers and build
                                upcoming interaction or motion rich features that then serve as
                                blueprints and usable UI code for the production
                                engineering implementation. This helps us
                                achieve a highly crafted experience in our final
                                product.

                                                This is a UX Lab demo done for Hotels.com to explore user sentiment as they work to add vacation rental inventory to their site. After Figma was unable to provide the intended sticky behavior, I created this prototype, that is a combination of live production data that power the images and availability calendar as well as static images for section that do not require user interaction.

                                                production, I spent my first year at
                                                Vrbo building this prototype of the

                                                prototype did consume our production
                                                APIs, but for the sake of stability,
                                                it now just uses a scraped, static
                                                version of this data. It is a
                                                responsive experience that works for
                                                both desktop and mobile web. Try it
