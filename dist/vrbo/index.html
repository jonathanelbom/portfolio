                            <p>
                                The production prototypes and demos serve to
                                work as parallel experiences to the production
                                app where I can collaborate with design to build
                                upcoming ux heavy features that then serve as
                                blueprints and usable UI code for the production
                                engineering implementation. This helps us
                                achieve a highly crafted experience in our final
                                product.

                                            properties and invite collaborators

                                            demos created by composing and

                                            Design System web components,
                                            focusing mainly on calendar

                                            demos serve to help UX designers
                                            understand what is possible in our
                                            tech stack, iterate and refine their

                                            and polish our users deserve. There
                                            are about 9 demos, selectable

                                            Though technically never used for
                                            production, I spent my first year at
                                            Vrbo building this prototype of the
                                            entire Traveler experience. This
                                            prototype did consume our production
                                            APIs, but for the sake of stability,
                                            it now just uses a scraped, static
                                            version of this data. It is a
                                            responsive experience that works for
                                            both desktop and mobile web. Try it
                                            out for a trip to "Chamonix".

                                            needed to be intergrated in many of

                                            A desktop study to explore card

                                            content and layouts on the homepage.
                                            This built off my extensive work
                                            with cards and the card carousel, as
                                            well as an easy grid modification.

                                            I used my extensive knowlege of
                                            mobile web gestures to build out the

                                            exploration around the possibilities
                                            for a more guided and flexible

                                            header) layout. Resize your viewport
                                            width (get down almost to mobile)
                                            and try a few of the options
