                                Hello! My name is Jonathan Elbom and I make
                                extraordinary user experiences come to life.

                            <p>
                                I live at the intersection of the user, data,
                                technology and design, and blend UX design and
                                client-side web engineering expertise into a
                                single progressive discipline. My focus on
                                understanding user experience problems and
                                technical capabilities enables me to craft
                                compelling experiences that are intuitive,
                                thoughtful, simple and delightful. My top
                                priority is delivering a great experience for
                                users by solving real-world problems. I approach
                                UX with empathy and compassion.

                                Over the span of my 20 year career, I have spent
                                my time as a designer, an engineer, an

                            <p class="Portfolio__work">
                                In addition to Vrbo, I maintain one contract
                                client, Dr Steven Grey (MSU), whom I partnered
                                with in 2011 to create Mental Modeler, a
                                fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping web application.
                                Mental Modeler is comprised of a concept mapper
                                and a scenario suite, both of which I designed
                                and implemented. We have been awarded numerous
                                grants, including a million dollar NSF
                                Cyberlearning grant in 2012. The software is
                                accessed by 50,000 users per year and has
                                produced more the 40 academic publications in
                                2018 alone. The concept mapper was originally
                                written in Actionscript 3 and I ported it to
                                React/Redux in 2019. I also created 2
                                instructional/promotional websites for Mental
                                Modeler.

                            <p class="Portfolio__work">
                                Prior to working at Vrbo, I worked at Pearson
                                Education (2010 - 2016) on their high-stakes,
                                summative assessment testing client (both
                                Actionscript 3/Flex and HTML5). At Pearson, I
                                also lead the design and UI development for
                                ABBI, their high-stakes testing item creation
                                tool. Before that, I reveled in the digital
                                agency life at Springbox (2007-2010), delivering
                                rich media experiences (aka ActionScript 3) to a
                                host of clients including Disney, PayPal, LG,
                                Nascar, Experien, and Dell. I considered my real
                                start to be at Enspire Learning (2001 - 2007)
                                where I made lasting connections with co-workers
                                and got my footing as both a UX designer and an
                                engineer. And, of course, all throughout my
                                career, I have done a random project here or
                                there, both for the love of creation and to
                                learn.
