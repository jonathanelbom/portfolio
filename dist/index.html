                    <h2>Crafted UX</h2>
                    <p>
                        With expertise in the design and implementation of
                        Motion, Interaction, and UI, it is my delight to be the
                        difference that moves good to great.

                                I make extraordinary user experiences come to
                                life.

                            <p>
                                I live at the intersection of the user, data,
                                technology and design, and blend UX design and
                                engineering expertise into a single progressive
                                discipline. My focus on understanding user
                                experience problems, technical capabilities, and
                                opportunities on both fronts enables me to craft
                                compelling experiences that are intuitive,
                                thoughtful, simple and delightful.

                                Over the span of my 20 year career, I have spent
                                my time as an individual contributor, a mentor,
                                a manager, and a champion for process
                                improvements that close the gaps between teams
                                in order to deliver world class user
                                experiences.

                                passionate multi-disciplinary teams who inspire
                                each other to take their craft to the next

                                For the last 4 years, I have worked as a Sr.
                                Design Technologist and Sr. Manager of Design
                                Technology at Vrbo. At Vrbo I have created
                                high-fidelity prototypes for usability labs as
                                well as production components for the live site.
                                I have contributed to bringing motion, layout,
                                and interaction polish to the final product and
                                have also composed production demos and advised

                                In addition to Vrbo, I maintain one contract
                                client, Dr Steven Grey (MSU), whom I partnered
                                with in 2011 to create Mental Modeler, a
                                fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping web application.
                                Mental Modeler is comprised of a concept mapper
                                and a scenario suite, both of which I designed
                                and implemented. We hae been award numerous
                                grants including a million dollar NSF
                                Cyberlearning grant in 2012. The software is
                                accessed by 50,000 users per year and has
                                produced more the 40 academic publications in
                                2018 alone. The concept mapper was original
                                writen in Actionscript 3 and I ported it to
                                React/Redux in 2019. I also created 2
                                instructional websites for Mental Modeler.

                                Prior to working at Vrbo, I work at Pearson
                                Education (2010 - 2016) on their high-stakes,
                                summative assessment testing client (both
                                Actionscript 3/Flex and HTML5). At Pearson, I
                                also designed and lead the UI development for
                                ABBI, their high-stakes testing content creation
                                tool. Before that, I reveled in the digital
                                agency life at Springbox (2007-2010), delivering
                                rich media experiences to a host of clients
                                including Disney, PayPal, LG, Nascar, Experien,
                                and Dell. I considered my real start to be at
                                Enspire Learning (2001 - 2007) where i made
                                lasting connections with co-workers and got my
                                footing as both a UX designer and an engineer.
                                And, of course, all throughout my career, I have
                                done a random project here or there, both for
                                the love of creation and to learn.
